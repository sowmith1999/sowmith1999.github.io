      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing of Markov Chains for a few years, never got to read about them or something with them. This is my look at them. The sole goal of this post is to get a good look at how Markov Chains work, we are going to do this by attempting to model some stock data. This post is initially written as a paper for a course I took.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of ways to model stock, and lot of good research is being done to solve this problem, and the better the algorithm to predict stock, the more money you can make and that can be a great motivator to innovate and have better stock prediction models. These industry models can be extremely complex and use proprietary heuristics that involve working with several different types of models. For our paper, we are not involving any external factors to base the predictions on, and not using macro economic trends or factors. and we are going to use only the candle data that we can fetch about a stock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
